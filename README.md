# Bitcoin Life Improvement Proposal (BLIP)

A simple checklist to improve your Bitcoin life. Pull requests are welcomed.

## How to use it?

Every time when you want to post, comment, upvote or like something go through this checklist and if it goes against it, do NOT do that.

## Checklist

### Don't be a fool

1. **Don't attempt to predict the Bitcoin price.** Time will prove you wrong. Dodge all questions.

2. **Don't tell anyone to buy Bitcoin.** You're annoying. Until Bitcoin becomes useful for them, you should not force it on them.

3. **Don't tell anyone NOT to buy Bitcoin.** You're not their father.

### Don't be a jerk

4. **Don't upvote or like negative or offensive content.** An exception is, if you are doing it anonymously, for example on Reddit. Offensive content has its place, yet your mental state is more important. The goal is to avoid it to backfire.

5. **Don't troll, don't engage a conversation in a negative or offensive way.** If you do not agree with something, it is the best time to bring your politest self. If you cannot figure out how to engage the conversation in a polite way, it's better to let it go. If you decide to engage, don't aim for compromise, don't lose your cool, and always have the last word.

### Value your privacy

6. **Don't post your transaction ids and addresses anywhere.**

7. **Don't tell anyone how much Bitcoin you have.**

8. **Don't ever expose how you value money.** For example: "I took my girlfriend out yesterday for her birthday and paid $50." "Lol, mate $50 is nothing." You may say this, but criminals, including tax authorities only hear this: "I want to be your next target."
